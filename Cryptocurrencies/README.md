# Cryptocurrencies
Module 18 Analysis

The purpose of this assignment is to use unsupervised machine learning to process data, to cluster data, to reduce dimensions, and to reduce principal components using Principal Components Analysis (PCA).

This report presents an analysis for clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. This report analyzes cryptocurrency data and presents four technical analysis deliverables, as follows:

• Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA (30 points)
• Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA (20 points)
• Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means (20 points)
• Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results (30 points)

The Python programs for each of the deliverables are presented in the following Jupyter Notebook:
